function [Beta, success] = func_solve_OI_enhanced(X_train, Y_train, opt)
% func_solve_MILP_enhanced solves the MILP (model (5) in the paper) using an 
% enhanced continuous relaxation-rounding algorithm.
%
% This enhanced version implements an extra step: if no free sampleâ€™s relaxed 
% z value exceeds the threshold (theta) in an iteration, then the algorithm 
% force-fixes the free samples with the highest z values until the allowed 
% number of outliers is reached.
%
% Inputs:
%   X_train           - m x n predictor matrix (first column is constant 1's).
%   Y_train           - m x numY response matrix.
%   opt               - options structure with fields:
%         opt.OI.bigM         : Big-M constant.
%         opt.OI.outlierRatio : Allowed fraction p of outliers.
%         opt.OI.theta        : Rounding threshold (e.g., 0.9).
%         opt.OI.maxIter      : Maximum number of iterations.
%         opt.YALMIP_options  : YALMIP solver options.
%
% Outputs:
%   Beta    - Estimated regression coefficients (n x numY).
%   success - Boolean flag indicating whether the optimization succeeded.
