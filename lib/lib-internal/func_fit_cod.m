function [U, R, V] = func_fit_cod(A, tol)
%COD    Complete orthogonal decomposition.
%       [U, R, V] = COD(A, TOL) computes a decomposition A = U*T*V,
%       where U and V are unitary, T = [R 0; 0 0] has the same dimensions as
%       A, and R is upper triangular and nonsingular of dimension rank(A).
%       Rank decisions are made using TOL, which defaults to approximately
%       LENGTH(A)*NORM(A)*EPS.
%       By itself, COD(A, TOL) returns R.
